And it was an important event. And it wasn’t just the event there, it was then the follow-up of people wanting to have meetings, have discussions, how is this going to work? What can we do to get buy-in here? When you’ve got Australia, a middle power, taking on these global giants.\nThere’s family reunion entitlements, all of the travel within guidelines.\nI’m saying it was within entitlements and Anika Wells was working on that trip as sports minister, participating the lifting up of para-sport.\nBut we’ve said very clearly that this won’t be perfect. Just like chances last night was Saturday night, somewhere in Australia, somewhere under 18s got a drink in a pub. But it’s the right thing to do for society to express its views, its judgement about what is appropriate.\n Continue reading..."

There was a bit more to it than that, but from Prague to Panama City, his scrunched contours were instantly recognisable, expressed in an exuberant parade of buildings that cranked and slumped as if hit by a wrecking ball, or crashed and whirled like dervishes, defying laws of gravity and structural logic. Though Gehry, who has died aged 96, came of age in the era of modernism, it was as if he were physically incapable of drawing a straight line.\nIn his prime, Gehry’s architecture was a rebuff to modernist imperators such as Mies van der Rohe and his po-faced injunction, “less is more”. The American postmodern theorist and architect Robert Venturi turned it on its head, quipping “less is a bore”. It summed up the maximalist Gehry perfectly.\n Continue reading..."
