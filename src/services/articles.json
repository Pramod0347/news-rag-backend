Iran’s Red Crescent reported more than 200 deaths and 747 injuries in daylong attacks across 24 provinces.\nAt least 100 people were reportedly killed in a strike on a primary school in Minab, in the south-east.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had earlier said there were “many signs” Khamenei was “no longer alive”, and Israeli officials briefed media that his body had been recovered.\nTehran fired retaliatory strikes against Israeli and US bases across the Middle East. Iran’s attacks targeted more than six countries, pulling in places that had been previously untouched by the escalating crisis.\nIn Israel, one person died and 22 others are injured, media reports say, after an Iranian missile strike hit a building in Tel Aviv.

Earlier, the country’s national security agency was also struck by an Iranian missile.\nSocial media footage also appeared to show a missile hitting the huge US naval base in Bahrain. In Kuwait, a drone crashed into the country’s main airport, wounding several employees and damaging the facility.\nIn Lebanon, gas stations across the country had lines 10 cars deep within an hour of the strikes.
