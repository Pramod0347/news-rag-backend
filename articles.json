So, really encourage people to talk to their doctors in terms of listening to health advice for our health officers and health ministers here to be listening to that health advice.\nThe pilots received a pressurisation warning light shortly after take off on Monday morning and followed standard operating procedures.\nWe understand this might have been an unsettling experience for our customers and want to thank them for their patience and understanding.\n Continue reading..."
